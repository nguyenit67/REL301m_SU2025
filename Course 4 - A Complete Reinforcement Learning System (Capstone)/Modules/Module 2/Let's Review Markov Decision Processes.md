# Let's Review Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

## What is a Markov Decision Process?

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are foundational in reinforcement learning, robotics, and artificial intelligence for modeling environments where an agent interacts with the world to achieve a goal[#][6][7].

## Core Components of an MDP

An MDP is typically defined by the tuple $(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$, where:

- **States ($S$):** The set of all possible situations the agent can be in[#][6][7].
- **Actions ($A$):** The set of all possible actions the agent can take in each state[#][6][7].
- **Transition Probabilities ($P$):** The probability $P(s'|s, a)$ of moving to state $s'$ from state $s$ after taking action $a$[#][6][7].
- **Reward Function ($R$):** The immediate reward $R(s, a, s')$ received after transitioning from state $s$ to $s'$ via action $a$[#][6][7].
- **Discount Factor ($\gamma$):** A value between 0 and 1 that determines the importance of future rewards[#][6][7].

## The Markov Property

The Markov property states that the future state depends only on the current state and action, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This "memoryless" property is central to the definition of MDPs[#][6][11].

---

## Policies

- **Policy ($\pi$):** A policy is a rule or function that specifies the action the agent will take in each state. Policies can be:
  - **Deterministic:** Always select the same action in a given state.
  - **Stochastic:** Select actions according to a probability distribution over actions in each state[#][6][11].

## Value Functions and the Bellman Equation

- **Value Function ($V^\pi(s)$):** The expected return (sum of rewards) when starting from state $s$ and following policy $\pi$ thereafter[#][6].
- **Action-Value Function ($Q^\pi(s, a)$):** The expected return when starting from state $s$, taking action $a$, and following policy $\pi$ thereafter[#][6].
- **Bellman Equation:** The value function satisfies the recursive Bellman equation:
  
  $$
  V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s'} P(s'|s, a) [R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]
  $$
  
  This equation relates the value of a state to the values of successor states[#][6].

## Solving MDPs

The goal in an MDP is to find an optimal policy $\pi^*$ that maximizes the expected return from each state. Two main algorithms for solving MDPs are:

- **Value Iteration:** Iteratively updates value estimates to find the optimal value function, then derives the optimal policy[#][6].
- **Policy Iteration:** Alternates between evaluating a policy and improving it until convergence to the optimal policy[#][6].

## Applications of MDPs

MDPs are widely used in:

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Modeling environments for agents to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error[#][6][12].
- **Robotics:** Planning and control for autonomous robots[#][6].
- **Operations Research:** Inventory management, scheduling, and resource allocation[#][10].
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Game playing, automated decision-making, and more[#][6][11].

| Component         | Description                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| States ($S$)      | All possible situations the agent can encounter      |
| Actions ($A$)     | All possible choices available to the agent          |
| Transitions ($P$) | Probabilities of moving between states given actions |
| Rewards ($R$)     | Immediate feedback for state-action transitions      |
| Policy ($\pi$)    | Rule for choosing actions in each state              |
| Value Function    | Expected return from a state or state-action pair    |
