# Initial Project Meeting: Formalizing the RL Problem

## Overview

The initial project meeting is a crucial step in starting a reinforcement learning (RL) project. The main goal is to translate a real-world problem into a formal Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is the foundation for designing and implementing RL solutions.

---

## Key Objectives

- **Problem Formalization:**  
  Clearly define the problem and express it in terms of states, actions, rewards, and transitions.

- **Project Scope:**  
  Set clear boundaries for what the project will address and what is out of scope.

- **Roles and Responsibilities:**  
  Assign specific tasks to team members, such as environment design, agent implementation, and evaluation.

## Steps in Formalizing the Problem

1. **Describe the Real-World Problem:**  
   Articulate the task, goals, and motivation for using RL.

2. **Identify the MDP Components:**  
   
   - **States ($S$):** What information describes the situation at each time step?
   - **Actions ($A$):** What choices does the agent have at each state?
   - **Rewards ($R$):** What feedback does the agent receive after taking an action?
   - **Transitions ($P$):** How does the environment change in response to actions?
   - **Episodes or Continuing:** Is the task episodic (has a start and end) or continuing?

3. **Define Success Criteria:**  
   Specify what success looks like and how the agentâ€™s performance will be measured.

4. **Discuss Constraints and Assumptions:**  
   List any limitations in the environment, data, or resources, and any assumptions about the agent or problem.

## Best Practices for the Initial Meeting

- **Collaborative Discussion:**  
  Involve all stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding of the problem and approach.

- **Document Everything:**  
  Record decisions, definitions, and open questions for future reference.

- **Iterative Refinement:**  
  Be ready to revisit and improve the problem formulation as the project progresses.

## Example Table: MDP Components

| Component   | Example Description                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| States      | Position and velocity of a robot          |
| Actions     | Move left, move right, stay               |
| Rewards     | +1 for reaching goal, 0 otherwise         |
| Transitions | Determined by physics and agent's actions |
| Episodes    | Task ends when goal is reached            |

## Key Takeaways

- Translating a real-world problem into an MDP is essential for RL projects.
- Clear scope, roles, and documentation help ensure project success.
- Collaboration and willingness to refine the problem are important for overcoming challenges.
