# Meeting with Adam: Getting the Agent Details Right

## Summary

This meeting focuses on the practical aspects of implementing a reinforcement learning agent, emphasizing the importance of getting the details right for successful learning and robust performance.

## 1. Parameter Choices

-   **Learning Rate (Step Size):**  
    Choosing an appropriate learning rate (alpha) is crucial. Too high can cause divergence; too low can slow learning.
-   **Exploration Parameters:**  
    Set values for epsilon (in epsilon-greedy) or temperature (in softmax) to balance exploration and exploitation.
-   **Discount Factor (Gamma):**  
    Determines the importance of future rewards versus immediate rewards.

## 2. Network Architecture

-   **Number of Layers and Units:**  
    Decide on the number of hidden layers and units per layer if using neural networks.
-   **Activation Functions:**  
    Choose suitable activation functions (e.g., ReLU, tanh) for non-linear approximation.
-   **Initialization:**  
    Proper weight initialization can affect learning stability and speed.

## 3. Algorithmic Details

-   **Update Rules:**  
    Implement the correct update equations for your chosen algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Expected Sarsa).
-   **Batch vs. Online Updates:**  
    Decide whether to update the agent after each step (online) or after collecting a batch of experiences.
-   **Optimizer:**  
    For neural networks, use optimizers like RMSProp or Adam to adapt learning rates and improve convergence.

## 4. Data Handling

-   **Experience Replay:**  
    Store and reuse past experiences to improve data efficiency and break correlations in sequential data.
-   **Batch Size:**  
    Set an appropriate batch size for updating the network if using experience replay.

---

## 5. Verification and Debugging

-   **Sanity Checks:**  
    Regularly verify that the agent is learning as expected (e.g., loss decreases, rewards increase).
-   **Parameter Sweeps:**  
    Systematically vary key parameters to understand their effect on performance.
-   **Visualization:**  
    Visualize learning curves, agent behavior, and value functions to diagnose issues.

---

## 6. Reproducibility

-   **Random Seeds:**  
    Set and record random seeds to ensure reproducibility of results.
-   **Documentation:**  
    Keep detailed notes on parameter settings and changes during experiments.

## Key Takeaways

-   The success of an RL agent depends not just on the choice of algorithm, but on careful attention to implementation details and parameter settings.
-   Systematic experimentation, verification, and documentation are essential for robust agent development and reliable results.
