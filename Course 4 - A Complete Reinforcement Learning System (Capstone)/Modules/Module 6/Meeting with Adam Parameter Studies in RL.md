# Meeting with Adam: Parameter Studies in RL

## Summary

This meeting emphasizes the importance of conducting parameter studies in reinforcement learning (RL) to understand how different hyperparameters affect agent performance. Parameter studies are a systematic way to explore, evaluate, and optimize the settings that control learning behavior and outcomes.

## Why Conduct Parameter Studies?

- **Sensitivity Analysis:**  
  Understand how changes in parameters (like learning rate, discount factor, batch size, or exploration rate) impact learning speed, stability, and final performance.
- **Robustness:**  
  Identify parameter settings that yield consistently good results across different runs or environments.
- **Optimization:**  
  Find the best-performing parameter values for your specific agent and task.
- **Scientific Understanding:**  
  Gain insight into the dynamics of RL algorithms and how they interact with environment characteristics.

## Typical Parameters to Study

- **Learning Rate (Alpha):** Controls how quickly the agent updates its knowledge.
- **Discount Factor (Gamma):** Determines the importance of future rewards.
- **Exploration Parameters:** Such as epsilon in epsilon-greedy or temperature in softmax.
- **Batch Size:** Number of samples used per update (for neural network-based agents).
- **Optimizer Settings:** For example, Adam or RMSProp hyperparameters.

## How to Perform a Parameter Study

1. **Select Parameter(s) to Study:**  
   Choose one or more parameters to systematically vary.
2. **Define Value Ranges:**  
   Decide on a set of values to test for each parameter.
3. **Run Experiments:**  
   For each parameter setting, train your agent and record relevant metrics (e.g., cumulative reward, convergence time).
4. **Aggregate Results:**  
   Average results over multiple runs to reduce variance.
5. **Visualize and Analyze:**  
   Plot performance as a function of parameter values to identify trends and optimal settings.

## Example: Learning Rate Study

Suppose you want to study the effect of the learning rate ($\alpha$) on agent performance:

- Choose a range, e.g., $\alpha \in \{0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1\}$.
- For each $\alpha$, run several training sessions and record the average return.
- Plot average return vs. $\alpha$ to find the best value.

## Best Practices

- **Multiple Runs:** Always average over several runs to account for stochasticity.
- **Keep Other Parameters Fixed:** Only vary one parameter at a time unless performing a grid search.
- **Document Everything:** Record parameter settings, random seeds, and results for reproducibility.
- **Visualize Results:** Use line plots, heatmaps, or box plots for clear interpretation.

## Key Takeaways

- Parameter studies are essential for tuning RL agents and understanding algorithm behavior.
- Systematic experimentation leads to more robust, reliable, and high-performing agents.
- Visualization and careful documentation are crucial for drawing meaningful conclusions.
