# Video: Gradient Descent for Training Neural Networks

### **Introduction**

- The lecture explains **gradient descent** as the foundation of **neural network training**.
- **Backpropagation** is the specific algorithm used to efficiently compute gradients for neural networks.
- The goal is to **minimize the loss function** by adjusting network parameters.

### **Gradient Descent and Loss Function**

- **Loss function** measures how far predictions are from correct values.
- The **gradient of the loss function** points in the direction of steepest ascent.
- By moving **opposite to the gradient**, the network minimizes the loss efficiently.
- The process involves **iterative weight updates** to optimize performance.

### **Backpropagation Algorithm**

1. **Define Loss**:
    - The loss is a function of neural network parameters.
    - Example: **Squared error** measures the difference between predictions and actual values.
2. **Compute Gradients Using Chain Rule**:
    - Starts from the **output layer** and moves **backward** through hidden layers.
    - Each weight update involves an **error term (Delta) times the input to that layer**.
3. **Layer-wise Updates**:
    - **Weight matrix B (last layer)**:
        - Gradient is computed first.
        - Updates depend on the **error signal from the final prediction**.
    - **Weight matrix A (hidden layer)**:
        - Depends on **previous errors**, recursively propagating backward.

### **Backpropagation Pseudocode**

- **Forward Pass**: Computes **predictions (yÌ‚)** using network weights.
- **Backward Pass**:
    1. Compute **Delta B** from output error.
    2. Compute **Delta A** using Delta B.
    3. Update parameters **B and A** using step sizes (learning rates).
- **Efficiency**:
    - **Starting at the output layer avoids recomputation**, making gradient computation more efficient.
    - **Extends naturally to deeper networks**.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Gradient descent minimizes loss by iteratively updating weights**.
- **Backpropagation is gradient descent optimized for neural networks**.
- **Layer-wise error propagation enables efficient weight updates**.
- **Choosing appropriate activation functions and loss functions impacts learning performance**.
